# 100 Days Of Code - Log

~~### Day 0: 7.12.2017~~
##### It begins (again)

**Today's Progress**: Starting my 100 Days of code

**Thoughts:** It's been 8 months since I paid $8k for a code camp, time to make it count. Gonna get with my bro and get this sucker moving:

### Day 0: 7.22.2017

**Today's Progress**: Starting again, working on Kelcy's site. WOW! Ended up worling for about 10 hours, got another theme installed all the way, old theme looks hopeless, constant PHPO errors since we're going from PHP 4 oto PHP 7

**Thoughts:** took some days off, I lack discipline! Esse quam videri!
